**Barcode Automation Demo**

This project demonstrates a VARIANT of a solution for automating computer barcode reading, which simplifies the workflow of companies working with barcode data. 
The automation process includes decoding barcode images, extracting relevant information, and performing data processing tasks. 
By automating these steps, companies can efficiently process large amounts of barcode data, reduce the number of errors made manually, and improve overall productivity.
#
*Overview*

	1. The Barcode Automation Demo showcases how to use Python and various libraries to achieve seamless barcode data processing. The project incorporates the following key components:

	2. Barcode Image Decoding: Utilizes the pyzbar library to decode barcode images and extract the encoded data.

	3. Data Processing: Demonstrates data cleaning and manipulation techniques to extract specific information from the decoded barcode data.

	4. Image Visualization: Uses the OpenCV library to visualize barcode images with annotated bounding boxes.
#
*Getting Started* 
	
	If u have Python 3.10:
	
	0. Download the project and 
	
	1. Prepare barcode images in the specified folder barcodes. Make sure the images contain valid barcode data for demonstration purposes.

	2. Run the main script:
		
		'''\python 
			__init__.py
		'''
#
*Functionality*

Upon running the main script, the Barcode Automation Demo performs the following tasks:

	1. Scans the barcodes folder to locate barcode images.

	2. Decodes barcode images using the pyzbar library.

	3. Extracts and processes relevant information from the decoded barcode data.

	4. Removes unwanted characters and formats the data for display.

	5. Annotates the barcode images with bounding boxes to visualize the detected barcodes.

	6. Displays the extracted information from each barcode on the console.
#
*Customization*

Feel free to customize this project according to your specific use case. 
You can change the logic of data processing, add more advanced detection methods, 
as well as change the format of the data you need or integrate the automation process into existing workflows.
